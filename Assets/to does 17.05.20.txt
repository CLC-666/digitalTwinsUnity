problem:
	- plcs are sending all data

solution:
	- only send update data
		- find a way to keep the tcp connection held by the plc

	this will mean that there is no wasted processing performance by unity


problem:
	- in need of a mathematical description of the conveyor for smooth movement

solution:
	- just do it lol

problem:
	- data incoming into unity is often missed or is slow to process DONE!!!!!!!!!!!

solution:
	- use threading in unity and have individual tcp connections to every plc to speed up data transfer.
	  These threads will also have to update and sort all variable values at the same time to minimise performance loss.

	- hopefully by minimising the stream of data from the plc side this will help with performance.

To Does:
	- create a new plc sim as we're away from the rig.
		- this will need one main script which calls another script manys times, each with its own thread using args for different IPs. 

	- create a working threaded tcp server(s) in unity to be able to receive all this data and efficiently process it. DONE!!!!!!!!!!!
	  Currently, unity is set up as TCP CLIENT! CHANGE IT!

	- once step one and two are completed, work on the mathemical description of the conveyor belts.
