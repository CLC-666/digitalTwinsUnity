all sensor data coming in

carrier spawn when rfid reached on physical
rfid register carrier number

set off on course round the conveyor.

# for when the sim is controlling the physical, a random carrier number will be generated
  from the avaiable carrier list -> this should control the MES software rather than
  the PLCs because the carriers could be in a different position on the phyisical so will
  take a bit of time to initially calibrate.

going to need a server client on every station
