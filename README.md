Research into Digital Twins Technology for my MSc at Middlesex Univeristy.

This is the ground work for a modular framework, free from company restrictions, enabling smaller businesses to run whatever controllers they want.

The framework is built in Unity.

For purposes of testing, this current configuation is designed to work on the Festo Cypber-Physical Factory at Middlesex Univeristy with the controllers being Siemens S7-1500
